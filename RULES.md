# FuzzyBuzzy Community Guidelines

Welcome to FuzzyBuzzy, the chat application designed for easy, real-time communication! To ensure a safe, positive, and enjoyable experience for everyone, we ask that all users adhere to the following community guidelines.

## 1. Respectful Communication

### A. Be Kind

Treat all members with respect and courtesy. Personal attacks, harassment, bullying, or derogatory comments based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or age are strictly prohibited.

### B. Keep it Friendly

Do not engage in excessive flaming, trolling, or deliberately provoking arguments. Disagreements are fine, but they must be handled respectfully and constructively.

### C. Privacy

Do not share private information (phone numbers, addresses, personal photos, financial details, etc.) about yourself or others. Do not use FuzzyBuzzy to dox (publicly expose private information about) any user or third party.

## 2. Prohibited Content and Conduct

The following types of content and activities are strictly forbidden on FuzzyBuzzy:

### A. Illegal Activity

Any content or conduct that promotes, facilitates, or encourages illegal acts is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, sharing links or instructions for illegal hacking, piracy, or fraud.

### B. Hateful & Discriminatory Content

Content that promotes violence, hatred, or discrimination against individuals or groups based on any characteristic (as listed in Section 1.A) is not allowed.

### C. Spam and Malicious Content

Do not flood chat rooms, repeatedly post irrelevant content, or use automated scripts/bots to disrupt the conversation. Do not share viruses, malware, phishing links, or other malicious content.

### D. Explicit Material

Pornographic or sexually explicit material is not permitted in public rooms. Private rooms may be subject to local legal restrictions.

## 3. Room Management

### A. Room Names

Keep room names respectful and relevant to the topic. Do not use offensive or misleading language in room titles.

### B. Protected Rooms

If you create a password-protected room, you are responsible for the content and users within it. Ensure that you and your users still adhere to the fundamental rules (Sections 1 and 2).

## 4. Moderation and Enforcement

### A. Reporting Violations

If you witness a violation of these guidelines, please report it immediately to the room moderator or platform administrator. Do not attempt to moderate or retaliate against the offending user yourself.

### B. Consequences

FuzzyBuzzy administrators and moderators reserve the right to enforce these guidelines at our sole discretion. Violations may result in:

A formal warning

Temporary suspension (kick/ban) from a room or the entire platform.

Permanent account termination.

### C. Judgment Calls

Sometimes, a situation may not explicitly fall under these rules, but still harms the community. We reserve the right to take action to protect the community and ensure a positive environment.
